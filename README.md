* ***glsTrends_site_level.rds*** :
Contains data for each site on slopes of functional and taxonomic diversity indices from the gls models used in "LT_macroinverts_site_trends.R". File created using "LT_combining_repsonse_trends.R". This file is necessary for illustrating the overall trends of biodiversity indices through time. Figures are generated using "LT_dentity_plots_trend_averages_and_distributions.R" and "LT_dentity_plots_trend_averages_and_distributions_wAllGroups.R". File can be viewed in R.

* ***glsTrends_site_level_drivers.rds*** :
Contains data for each site on slopes of environmental drivers from the gls models used in "LT_drivers_site_trends.R". File created using "LT_combining_driver_trends.R". This file is necessary for illustrating the overall trends of environmental drivers through time. Figures are generated using "LT_dentity_plots_trend_averages_and_distribution_drivers.R" and "LT_dentity_plots_trend_averages_and_distribution_nutrient_drivers.R". File can be viewed in R.

* ***glsTrends_drivers_site_level.rds*** :

File created using "LT_combining_driver_estimates.R". This file is necessary for illustrating the overall responses of biodiversity indices to the the suite of environmental predictors used. Figures are generated using "LT_overall_driver_analyses_figures.R". File can be viewed in R.

* ***null_model_outputs_wNAs.csv*** :
Contains the null model outputs of the functional diversity metrics. This file is manually uploaded into the "Calculation_of_functional_indices.R" instead of having to rerun the null models every time I would like to rerun the code. PLEASE NOTE: Null model analyses are computationally exhausting. When running the null model analyses, I recommend first changing the number of iterations to 3, checking that the code runs smoothly, and thereafter increasing the number of iterations to 999. One should be aware that null model analyses can take a surpringly long time to run, for example on my machine (Dell XPS 15, 12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-12900HK 2.50 GHz, 32.0 GB of RAM, with two graphics cards) it took ~8 hours per funcitonal index (e.g., FRic). Thus, patience is key.
